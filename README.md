Q1: How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
A:  The loop will run for every 10 increment on X. 

Q2: What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
A:  Var x = 10 defines the value of X, which is 10.
    x < width - 10, the loop will pass the test if the x is less than 400-10, which is 390.
    X = X + 10, after the loop runs, the x will increase 10 for the next run. 
    
Q3: How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
Aï¼š 40 times.

Q4: What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
A:  1) changing the increment within the for-loop
    2) 

Q5: How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
